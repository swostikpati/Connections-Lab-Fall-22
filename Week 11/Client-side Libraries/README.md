# Client Side Libraries

## D3 - Powerful data visualization library
D3 works on SVGs. We create a SVG block and then add elements to the SVG block and manipulate it. It works on the principle of chaining of command.

## Three.js - Powerful 3d visualizer
Very very powerful. Uses GPU.

(Visual editor)

Before using threejs, we need to create a scene, a camera, and a renderer. An orbit controller is also advisable to move around and zoom in and out.

To create an item, we need geometry, the material, and the mesh. A mesh combines the material and the mesh.

## ml5
Machine learning library inspired by p5 (similar in terms of syntaxes). It has several trained models, and we just need to deploy it.

## Aframe
It is great for AR/VR. It is built on top of three.js which makes it easier to use and still is flexible. To use this we need to add an HTML tag specifically meant for HTML. Eg. ```<a-box>```

## Tone.js
Great for music. Wrapper over p5. It gives a lot of options to make and manipulate music. Works with both npm install and a cdn

## Rivescript
Simple AI chatbot. Create a file called .rive with questions and answers. Is customizable.

## Leaflet
Used to integrate maps. 

## p5.play
Games with an inbuilt physics library. Wrapper over a lot of smaller but powerful libraries.
