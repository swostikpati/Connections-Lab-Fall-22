# NYUAD Events

## Overview

NYUAD Events is a web application based in React JS. With the lifting of covid restrictions, the number of events on campus have increased rapidly. Due to this, we find that students have often struggled to keep track of all the events that are happening on campus and many-a-time end up missing special events that were really important to them. This is where NYUAD Events comes in. It keeps track of all the events happening on campus, and displays all the relevant information about them (date, location, description, etc). It also provides the users the ability to create new events and set events they want to attend as favorites.

## Personal Motivation

The creation of this application was basically a practical venture of mine to understand the core concepts of the React JS library. Throughout the documentation of the project, I have highlighted my key learnings about the library.

## Wireframe

This is the [initial wireframe]() of the website. I have mostly stuck to it with minor changes here and there.

## Learnings

## Challenges

• Understanding ReactJS was like re-learning many parts of Front-end development. Navigating through this path was definitely quite difficult and a very big challenge especially considering the time constraint. I am still in the process of becoming comfortable with the core principles but I feel I am at a much better place than when I began from.

• The documentation of React has changed a lot over the years. This makes it very difficult to keep up with tutorials (even recent ones) as things keep changing a lot. This definitely posed as a challenge as there were several instances where I was facing errors for code that once was completely correct. But with some understanding of the documentation, I was able to adapt quite fast.

## Potential Improvements

The application is at a very rudimentary stage and there is a lot of scope for improvement. Some of the very apparant ones are:

• There is no check on who has the access to create events. Without this, there is a possibility of random events being created by random people and even multiple instances of the same event.

• The user interface of the application is very generic and provides a major opportunity to customize it more to the school it is representing. 

• More features, like being able to RSVP directly from the application, photo gallery, calander integration, etc. can be added.
