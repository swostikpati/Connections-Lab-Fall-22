                <h4>INITIAL USER INTERFACE</h4>
                <p>This is a view of the inital user interface the user is greeted to. The user is asked to input their
                    weight using 4 buttons (+/-5 and +/-1). When the user has finally finished putting their weight,
                    they click the Done button. The code for taking input from the user is two-fold -
                    creating the static interface for the user to interact and taking input through touch. All the
                    buttons are designed in a specific way so as to avoid multiple inputs due to the refresh rate of the
                    screen.</p>

                <p>The final user interface shows the user the number of steps they took, the distance they traveled
                    and the number of calories they burnt during the period. The screen keeps getting updated every
                    200 ms as the function gets called in the loop function. The image below shows how the final UI
                    looks like just after the user has entered there weight.</p>

                <h5>(After Walking)</h5>
                <p>This is the view of the final user interface after the user has walked a certain distance. The device
                    rapidly calculates the steps, computes the distance traveled and calories burnt in real time and
                    shows it to the user. The code has specific components designed to prevent detection of rapid
                    movements as steps thus ensuring a high level of accuracy while detecting steps and calculating
                    calories.</p>

        <h2>Project Testing</h2>
        <p>Each one of us walked several steps with the M5 stack tied to their wrists, or in their
            pockets(mimicking a mobile phone). The number of steps that the user took were compared to
            the final step count shown in the screen. It was found that for short distances the step counter
            gave almost accurate results with an error rate of +/-2%. For long distances, the results were
            within the error rate of step calculation was +/-5%.
            To verify our device with other similar devices, we compared the step calculation by our device
            to that of Google fit and the observations are laid down below:
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/testing_01.png" alt="testing image 1">
        <p>The left image shows the initial step count and the right-most one shows the final step count in
            Google Fit. The center one shows the calculation of steps in the M5 stack for the same walk. As
            we can see the step count in our device <strong>(286 steps)</strong> is very close to the one calculated by
            Google Fit <strong>(2774 - 2474 = 300 steps)</strong>. Similarly. the distance traveled and calories burnt
            were also verified in this manner.

        <h2>Project Research</h2>
        <p>The process of project development wasn't an easy one. There was a lot of work that went about making the
            device a success after overcoming several challenges during the process. Creating a viable interface for
            user interaction, finding a robust step-detection
            algorithm, avoiding rapid movement detection, implementing most accurate formulae for distance estimation
            and calorie calculation, etc. needed a lot of research and implementation work in the backend which are
            beyond the scope of the portfolio. The links to the Github repository of the project and the final project
            paper are given below for the curious!</p>
