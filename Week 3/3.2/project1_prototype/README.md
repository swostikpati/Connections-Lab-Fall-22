# Project Documentation - Project 1 Prototype

## Wireframe

This is the initial wireframe of the application. The wireframe hasn't yet been implemented fully (it will be by the end of project 1). There might be some design changed that get accumulated by the end of the project.

## API

The project uses the api from the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) Website. It provides access to thousands of high-resolution royalty-free stock images. My application requires access to a lot of images to cater for diverse searches. To access the API I first created a developer account on Unsplash and created an application. I was then assigned an Access key and a Secret Key. After going through some documentation, I was able to understand the API endpoints where I could make requests to. Using Postman, I learned the various things present in the JSON object.
